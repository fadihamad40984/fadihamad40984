## 🔬 Featured projects
Below are concise, professional summaries of selected projects from my GitHub — each shows the problem, approach, and outcome.

- wasel — Delivery application (React / React Native / Node.js / MongoDB)  
  Repo: https://github.com/OmarJarbou/wasel  
  What: Full delivery platform with mobile apps (React Native) and a web dashboard (React), backed by a Node.js API and MongoDB.  
  Problem: Provide a reliable, low-latency delivery experience across Android/iOS and web for couriers, customers, and dispatchers.  
  Approach: Shared JS/TS models where possible, native-feeling RN UI for couriers, responsive React dashboard for operations, real-time location updates and status sync, robust API with authentication and role-based access.  
  Outcome: End-to-end delivery flows supporting assignments, tracking, and admin controls; designed for scale and quick iteration.

- Event_Planner — Event management (Java + BDD)  
  Repo: https://github.com/fadihamad40984/Event_Planner--Software-project--  
  What: Java-based event planning system with Behaviour-Driven Development (Gherkin) acceptance tests.  
  Problem: Deliver predictable event features with clear acceptance criteria for QA and stakeholders.  
  Approach: Domain-driven Java implementation paired with Gherkin scenarios to drive development and testing.  
  Outcome: Repeatable acceptance tests and a stable baseline for feature expansion.

- Profile-Website — Personal site / UI showcase (HTML / CSS / JS)  
  Repo: https://github.com/fadihamad40984/Profile-Website  
  What: Lightweight, responsive personal website to showcase projects and contact details.  
  Approach: Mobile-first design, accessibility considerations, and performance optimizations for fast load times.  
  Outcome: Clean portfolio with easy content updates and strong performance metrics.

(If you'd like a full case study for any of these — Problem → Constraints → Solution → Results — send 2–3 notes per project and I’ll expand them into a one-page case study.)
