## Current focus
- Advanced TypeScript patterns in large React/React Native apps.  
- Scalable Flutter architectures and native integrations.  
- Strengthening API contracts and contract tests for backend services.

## How to work with me
- I prefer issues + PRs for code collaboration.  
- I’m open to short contracts, mentoring, and technical interviews.  
- For hiring: clear acceptance criteria, a small take-home or design brief, and a code-review conversation works best.
